# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a streamlined "price comparison" web app that allows users to quickly search for products available for purchase online and compare prices between several major online retailers. The app will allow users to view historical price trends for a particular product so that they will be able to make well-informed purchasing decisions. 

The idea for this project came from my own recent experience of building a PC and finding myself constantly searching sites such as SlickDeals, Amazon, and Newegg to find the best prices for the components needed. 
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.

Search: Users will be able to search for any product they are interested in purchasing.

Compare: Users will be able to compare prices across several online retailers.

Watchlist: Users will be able to add products to a personal "watchlist" that will generate an optional alert when prices drop.
### Technologies
Python

Django

Django ORM

PostgreSQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
I anticipate that I'll have to integrate a public API or utilize web scraping in order to retrieve current pricing information from the various retailers I'll be pitting against each other. I have no experience with the Django framework or Django ORM, but I plan to learn how to use them in order to retain user data and map specific product information to personal watchlists. If time allows, adding interactive features with JavaScript will result in a more positive user experience.
